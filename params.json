All other values are ignored.\r\n\r\nYou can create files to use as input for Getafix with Wireshark. Just use Wireshark to capture the packets and save the result as a K12 text file.\r\n\r\n![Input file selection and transmission options](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/599926/images/screenshot-getafix-01.png)\r\n![Transmission progress window](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/599926/images/screenshot-getafix-02.png)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can download the executable JAR file from [https://github.com/cyberpython/Getafix/downloads](https://github.com/cyberpython/Getafix/downloads).\r\n\r\n## Build instructions\r\n\r\n    cd <path_where_the_code_is>\r\n    ant clean jar\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo run the graphical user interface, double click on the JAR file under Windows or Linux. Another way is to run the application with no arguments:\r\n\r\n    java -jar Getafix.jar\r\n\r\nTo run it using the CLI open a terminal and give:\r\n\r\n    java -jar Getafix.jar <remote_ip_or_host_name> <port> <offset> <delay> <path_to_input_file>\r\n    \r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n* `<remote_ip_or_host_name>` is the IP address or host name of the receiver\r\n* `<port>` is the target port of the receiver\r\n* `<offset>` is the number of bytes to be ignored for each packet (e.g. to omit captured Ethernet, IP and UDP headers) - A typical offset for UDP packets captured on Ethernet is 42\r\n* `<delay>` is the number of milliseconds to wait between packet transmissions\r\n* `<path_to_input_file>` is the path to the text file containing the byte values to be transmitted\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Georgios Migdos <cyberpython@gmail.com>\r\nThe source code is available under the terms of the MIT license."}
